                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                    names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                    dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                    JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                    "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                    You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                    identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                    _name.

            <header><h1>Declaring Variables</h1></header>
            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Constants</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                    represent a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>

                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                    is executed without problems.
                </p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

            <header><h1>Data Types</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                              other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                              unique and immutable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                    to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                    are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                    objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                    your application can perform.
